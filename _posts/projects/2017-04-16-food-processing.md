  <p>The future of food automation is exciting, with a growing labour
shortage and a higher demand for high quality, fresh foods at reasonable
costs.  However, it is typically very difficult to add automation to
food processing due to the complex and varied nature of the products and
strict standards on health, production, and quality.<br><br>

The institute has collaborated with food manufacturers to bring novel automation technologies into this challenging domain.  Our technologies can greatly improve efficiency in the plants and the quality of processed foods.  This, in turn, will ultimately increase the value of the foods to both our industry partners and the consumer.  </p>
