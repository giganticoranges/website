  <p>The Robotics Institute and Turfbot Corporation teamed up to develop a robot rover for groundskeeping.  The autonomous rover was built on a common tractor platform to reduce costs to the customer, and had to safely navigate its way around a set of waypoints.  Safety was a major concern, and the rover was outfitted with sensors to detect and intelligently react to unforseen obstacles or even people jumping out in front of it.<br><br>

At the end of a successful partnership, Turfbot is currently being developed further by Turfbot Corporation.</p>
