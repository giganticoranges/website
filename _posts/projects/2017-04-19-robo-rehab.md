<br>The Institute conducts research within the field of rehabilitation robotics in order to build intelligent robotic systems that can provide an opportunity to improve the quality of life for people. Research in this area explores the use of robots as rehabilitation tools for people who have experienced limb disabilities or impairments caused by a severe injury or accident. Researchers at the Institute have collaborated with physiotherapists to develop an intelligent user-friendly therapeutic robotic system based on the anthropometry of the stroke population.</p>
