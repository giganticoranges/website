<br>Canada has a significant and growing greenhouse industry that almost doubled in the last ten years. There are currently around 2000 acres of greenhouse operations in Canada. Crops developed within greenhouses vary from flowers to vegetables and fruits. Greenhouse operations are known to be labour intensive. The objective of this research is to develop an intelligent robotics technology that has significant functional capabilities relevant to a wide range of greenhouse operators. The main challenges are accuracy, cycle time, and cost. The robotics system must be able to perform various tasks at the same accuracy and speed of manual labour but at a cost that is reasonable for a typical greenhouse farmer. Present projects at the Institute explore the possible roles of robots in greenhouse environments.</p>
